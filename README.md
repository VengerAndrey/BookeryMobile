# Bookery Mobile

### Idea

**Bookery** &mdash; is a multiplatform application that in general stands for a cloud drive. It uses a hierarchical storage, supports basic operations like upload/download/rename/delete and supports *sharing*. It is possible to share and hide nodes (folders or files) recursively.

### Module info

This is the Android client app. Project is splitted into domain, API and application itself layers. 
*Currently it works with the deprecated version of [BookeryWebAPI](https://github.com/VengerAndrey/BookeryWebApi)*.

### Tech stack

- **.NET Core 5.0**, **Xamarin .NET**
- **MVVM**
- **JWT** authorization
